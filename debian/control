 supports password changing, auto-away, creation of new accounts, searching,
 file transfer, acknowledged messages, SMS, client identification, logging,
 scripting, transcoding, multi-UIN usage and other features that makes it a
 very complete yet simple internationalized client supporting the current
 ICQ v8 protocol.
 .
 It has leading support for (ICQ2002+/ICQ Lite/ICQ2go) unicode encoded
 messages unreached by other ICQ clones.

 A lot of other ICQ clients are based in spirit on mICQ, nevertheless
 mICQ is still _the_ console based ICQ client.
