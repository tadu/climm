	* src/file_util.c, src/micq.c, include/micq.h: Add config option
	  "Del_is_Del" tied to global BOOL del_is_bs, (default TRUE).
	* src/mreadline.c: Put backspace and delete processing into
	  seperate functions R_process_input_backspace() and
	  R_process_input_delete(); now ^h triggers backspace, ESC[3~
	  delete, and the delete character backspace or delete depending on
	  whether del_is_bs is set. Allow different arrow key codes
	  and stop beeping at end of line etc.
