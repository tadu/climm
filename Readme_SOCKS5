############# THE BEOS PORT IS NO LONGER BROKEN ################

The little story...

At work i'm behind a socks5 firewall, so i needed an ICQ clone for BeOS
with socks5 support, there's one, ICBM, but it crashes at login, so it's
not usable. I managed to use mICQ, a great text mode ICQ clone under FreeBSD,
I found a port of version 0.3.2 (ported by catlettc@canvaslink.com) for BeOS
and decided to add socks5 support.

First i took the sources of ICBM to see the socks5 implementation, in c++
but easily adaptable in c, however i was having difficulties with some
functions. I discovered that ICBM, based on BeCQ, is based on mICQ, i also
discovered the socks5 support included in ICBM come from libicq.tar.gz
available on freshmeat iirc, and libicq is based also on mICQ! If
everything is based on mICQ, it must be a good client, and the one to
modify. So i did it ;)

If you launch micq for the first time it'll ask you for socks5 server/port

Parameters are saved in the .micqrc file so you can change it.

I don't need authentification here so i don't know if this part works.
