 : But the idea is to add PGP encryption to micq working with GNU Privacy
 : Guard.  There is a plugin for ICQ that enables PGP that's where I got
 : the idea.  As it stands right now you can't use micq to send messages
 : encoded with GPG because the max message size isn't large enough to send
 : your public key, etc.  After thinking about it, I was quickly in over my
 : head.

various people:
 : add https support
 : add missing v8 pieces
 : server side contact list
 : contact groups
 : history of messages
 : alias for commands
 : tab completion (check)
 : configurable colors
 : saving personal information
 : fix memory leaks
 : fix contact list download segfault
 : finish implementing file transfer
 : fix missing online flags
 : fix wrong-destination messages (fixed)

I have been talking with friends about mICQ and about how much we like it ..
A couple of things have come up:
- It would be nice to know just how many messages a person has sent while
  one was away - regarding the 'last' function.
- All mode changes should be in a central system log and not each user
- Trillian compatibility would be great.
- last <uin> doesn't show the time.
