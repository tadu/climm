Description: text based ICQ client with many features
DescDetail: <<
mICQ is a portable, small, yet powerful console based ICQ client. It
supports password changing, auto-away, creation of new accounts, and other
features that makes it a very complete yet simple client supporting the
current ICQ v8 protocol.

A lot of other ICQ clients are based in spirit on mICQ, nevertheless
mICQ is still _the_ console based ICQ client.
