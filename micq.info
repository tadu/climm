Description: text/line based ICQ client with many features
DescDetail: <<
mICQ is a portable, small, yet powerful console based ICQ client. It
supports password changing, auto-away, creation of new accounts, searching,
file transfer, acknowledged messages, SMS, client identification, logging,
scripting, transcoding, multi-UIN usage and other features that makes it a
very complete yet simple internationalized client supporting the current
ICQ v8 protocol.

It has leading support for (ICQ2002+/ICQ Lite/ICQ2go) unicode encoded
messages unreached by other ICQ clones.

A lot of other ICQ clients are based in spirit on mICQ, nevertheless
mICQ is still _the_ console based ICQ client.
