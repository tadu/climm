$Id$ -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

current Version: 0.4.10.5
====================================

a) About mICQ

mICQ is a very portable ICQ Console Client originally written by Matthew D.
Smith. mICQ is known to compile on many systems, including (but not limited
to) Linux, BSD, AIX, HPUX, BeOS, Windows and AmigaOS.

When the Author passed away 2001-01-05, some of us users overtook the
"leadership" of the project and its now actively developed by some of us
freaks.

For some time, Rico Glöckner <rg@micq.org> maintained the code. He also set
up the mailing list and hosts www.micq.org.

Right now, Rüdiger Kuhlmann maintains the code. All code to implement the
new v8 ICQ protocol is from him. In fact, huge parts of mICQ have been
rewritten completely by him.

e) Download

Download mICQ sources and binaries from

    <URL:http://www.micq.org/>

f) CVS

Required is the cvs client, autoconf 2.57 or greater and automake 1.7 or
greater. automake 1.7.2 is recommended, however.

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@micq.org:/var/lib/cvs co -r stable-0-4-10 micq

To prepare the maintainer generated files:

$ ./prepare

This will run aclocal, autoheader, automake -ac and autoconf.

Note that if you don't have current autotools, there is a CVS snapshot that
you can download the includes the generated files just like in the release.
It does, however, contain CVS directories, so you can still use "cvs up" to
update the checkout. Usually I upload a new snapshot when I make changes
to configure.ac or any of the Makefile.am files.

If that isn't enough because you made too much changes, you can link the
generated files from a CVS snapshot to a CVS checkout like this:

  cd micq  # the CVS check-out
  ln -s ../micq-cvs/{install-sh,config.guess,config.sub,configure,depend,mkinstalldirs} .
  cd ../micq-cvs  # the CVS snapshot
  find . -name "*.in" -exec ln -s ../micq-cvs/\{\} ../micq/\{\}

g) Compile

$ ./configure --help
    Please read the help carefully. Particularly, if you are not "root",
    please watch the --prefix parameter.
$ ./configure 
$ make
$ su
# make install


h) Usage

Although mICQ has some command line options, for a quick start just type
'micq'. If you don't have a valid configuration, the setup wizard will guide
you through the process of creating one for you.

i) NOTE!

mICQ is in a phase of being re-organized, thus things may change
very fast. When in doubt, have a Look at http://www.micq.org/ or
the mailing list or contact me via ICQ.
However, look out for announcements on Freshmeat.net.
