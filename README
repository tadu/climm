$Id$

current Version: 0.4.9
====================================

a) about mICQ

mICQ is a very portable ICQ Console Client originally
written by "Matthew D. Smith". mICQ is known to compile
on many systems, including (but not limited to) Linux,
BSD, BeOS, Windows and Amiga.

When the Author passed away 2001-01-05, some of us Users
overtook the "leadership" of the project and its now
actively developed by some of us freaks.

For some time, Rico Gloeckner <rg@micq.org> maintained the code. He also set
up the mailinglist and hosts www.micq.org.

Right now, Rüdiger Kuhlmann maintains the code. All code to implement the
new v8 ICQ protocol is from him.



b) Mailinglist

They are hosted by <rg@micq.org>.

c) Download

Primary Mirror
    http://www.micq.org/

CVS (do that only if you know what cvs is):

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@micq.ukeer.de:/usr/local/cvsroot co micq
[hit enter] (=empty Password)

To prepare the maintainer generated files:

$ ./prepare

This will run aclocal, autoheader, automake -a and autoconf. It requires
autoconf 2.50.


d) Compile

$ ./configure --help
    Please read the help carefully. Particulary, if you are not "root",
    please watch the --prefix Parameter.
$ ./configure 
$ make
$ su
# make install


e) Usage

just type 'micq'
It will ask you for an UID (if you have none, just type '0') and a
Password.


h) Docs

You'll find original docs in the doc/ subdirectory. This also contains a
dump of http://maipm.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de/~kuhlmann/ICQ/ , which
features a database of the ICQ protocl.


i) NOTE!

mICQ is in a Phase of being re-organized, thus things may change
very fast. When in Doubt, have a Look at http://micq.org/ or
email mc@verdinet.de or...
However, look out for announcements on Freshmeat.net.

We will see how the Future of mICQ looks.
