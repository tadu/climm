$Id$

current Version: 0.4.6
====================================


a) Copyright and stuff

Code written by Matt D. Smith is released under the
BSD Licence. He never had a real Licence, but i got this:
| Micq is not really under any license.  If you need to
| list one make it BSD.  I tell anyone who asks they can
| use it but give me credit which as I understand it is
| the essense of BDS license.  I never planned for micq
| to take off so much and so never worried about a
| license.
| There will hopefully be a new version by the end of
| february and you could include that in the next
| debian.

I got this cite from the debian-package maintainer from
micq.

Beginning from 0.4.7 all the Code is released
as BSD-ish Licence - when not otherwise noted.

No-one from the micq Project is in any way affiliated with
Mirabelis. We get neither money nor any hints from them.


b) about mICQ

mICQ is a very portable ICQ Console Client originally
written by "Matthew D. Smith". mICQ is known to compile
on many systems, including (but not limited to) Linux,
BSD, BeOS, Windows and Amiga.

When the Author passed away 2001-01-05, some of us Users
overtook the "leadership" of the project and its now
actively developed by some of us Freaks.
