micq - a portable ICQ Console Client
$Id$

current Version: 0.4.8
====================================

a) about mICQ

mICQ is a very portable ICQ Console Client originally
written by "Matthew D. Smith". mICQ is known to compile
on many systems, including (but not limited to) Linux,
BSD, BeOS, Windows and Amiga.

When the Author passed away 2001-01-05, some of us Users
overtook the "leadership" of the project and its now
actively developed by some of us Freaks.

I, Rico Gloeckner, want to give up Maintainership. Anyone
who feels that he could do that may feel free to contact me.
Anyone who is willing to maintain micq will get my support.

c) Download

Primary Mirror
    http://www.micq.org/

CVS (do that only if you know what cvs is)
$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@micq.org:/usr/local/cvsroot
$ cvs login
[leave password empty]
$ cvs -z9 co micq

(Yes: '$' is the Prompt only ;)

To prepare the maintainer generated files:

$ ./prepare

This will run aclocal, autoheader, automake -a and autoconf. It requires
autoconf 2.50.


d) Compile

$ ./configure --help
    Please read the Help carefully. Particulary, if you are not "root",
    please watch the --prefix Parameter.
$ ./configure 
$ make
$ su
# make install


e) Usage

just type 'micq'
It will ask you for an UID (if you have none, just type '0') and a
Password.


h) You'll find original docs in the src/ Subdirectory.


i) NOTE!

mICQ is in a Phase of being re-organized, thus things may change
very fast. When in Doubt, have a Look at http://micq.org/ or
email mc@verdinet.de or...
However, look out for announcements on Freshmeat.net.

We will see how the Future of mICQ looks.
