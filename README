====================================

a) About climm

climm is a very portable ICQ Console Client originally written by Matthew D.
Smith. climm is known to compile on many systems, including (but not limited
to) Linux, BSD, AIX, HPUX, BeOS, Windows and AmigaOS.

When the Author passed away 2001-01-05, some of us users overtook the
"leadership" of the project and its now actively developed by some of us
freaks.

For some time, Rico Glöckner <rg@climm.org> maintained the code. He also set
up the mailing list and hosts www.climm.org.

Right now, Rüdiger Kuhlmann maintains the code. All code to implement the
new v8 ICQ protocol is from him. In fact, huge parts of climm have been
rewritten completely by him.

e) Download

Download climm sources and binaries from

    <URL:http://www.climm.org/>

f) SVN (subversion)

Required is the svn client, autoconf 2.59 or greater and automake 1.9 or
greater. automake 1.10 is recommended, however.

svn co http://svn.climm.org/climm/

To prepare the maintainer generated files:

$ ./prepare

This will run aclocal, autoheader, automake -ac and autoconf.

Note that if you don't have current autotools, there is a SVN snapshot that
you can download the includes the generated files just like in the release.
It does, however, contain .svn directories, so you can still use "svn up" to
update the checkout. Usually I upload a new snapshot when I make changes
to configure.ac or any of the Makefile.am files.

If that isn't enough because you made too much changes, you can link the
generated files from a SVN snapshot to a SVN checkout like this:

  cd climm  # the SVN check-out
  ln -s ../climm-svn/{install-sh,config.guess,config.sub,configure,depend,mkinstalldirs} .
  cd ../climm-svn  # the SVN snapshot
  find . -name "*.in" -exec ln -s ../climm-svn/\{\} ../climm/\{\}

g) Compile

$ ./configure --help
    Please read the help carefully. Particularly, if you are not "root",
    please watch the --prefix parameter.
$ ./configure 
$ make
$ su
# make install


h) Usage

Although climm has some command line options, for a quick start just type
'climm'. If you don't have a valid configuration, the setup wizard will guide
you through the process of creating one for you.

i) NOTE!

climm is in a phase of being re-organized, thus things may change
very fast. When in doubt, have a Look at http://www.climm.org/ or
the mailing list or contact me via ICQ.
However, look out for announcements on Freshmeat.net.
