a) About mICQ

mICQ is a very portable ICQ Console Client originally written by Matthew D.
Smith. mICQ is known to compile on many systems, including (but not limited
to) Linux, BSD, AIX, HPUX, BeOS, Windows and AmigaOS.

When the Author passed away 2001-01-05, some of us users overtook the
"leadership" of the project and its now actively developed by some of us
freaks.

For some time, Rico Gloeckner <rg@micq.org> maintained the code. He also set
up the mailinglist and hosts www.micq.org.

Right now, Rüdiger Kuhlmann maintains the code. All code to implement the
new v8 ICQ protocol is from him.

e) Download

Download mICQ sources and binaries from

    <http://www.micq.org/>

f) CVS

Required is the cvs client, autoconf 2.50 or greater and automake 1.4 or
greater. autoconf 2.53 and automake 1.5 are recommended, however.

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@micq.org:/usr/local/cvsroot co micq

To prepare the maintainer generated files:

$ ./prepare

This will run aclocal, autoheader, automake -ac and autoconf.

g) Compile

$ ./configure --help
    Please read the help carefully. Particulary, if you are not "root",
    please watch the --prefix parameter.
$ ./configure 
$ make
$ su
# make install


h) Usage

Although mICQ has some command line options, for a quick start just type
'micq'. If you don't have a valid configuration, the setup wizard will guide
you through the process of creating one for you.


i) Docs

You'll find original docs in the doc/ subdirectory. This also contains a
dump of http://www.stud.uni-karlsruhe.de/~uck4/ICQ/ , which
features a database of the ICQ protocol.

j) Future

Planned features for the future include v8 file transfer (no other client
can do that as of yet).

k) NOTE!

mICQ is in a phase of being re-organized, thus things may change
very fast. When in doubt, have a Look at http://micq.org/ or
email mc@verdinet.de or...
However, look out for announcements on Freshmeat.net.
