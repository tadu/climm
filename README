current Version: 0.4.6
====================================


a) Copyright and stuff

Code written by Matt D. Smith is released under the
BSD Licence. He never had a real Licence, but i got this:
| Micq is not really under any license.  If you need to
| list one make it BSD.  I tell anyone who asks they can
| use it but give me credit which as I understand it is
| the essense of BDS license.  I never planned for micq
| to take off so much and so never worried about a
| license.
| There will hopefully be a new version by the end of
| february and you could include that in the next
| debian.

I got this cite from the debian-package maintainer from
micq.

Beginning from 0.4.7 all the Code is released
as BSD-ish Licence - when not otherwise noted.

No-one from the micq Project is in any way affiliated with
Mirabelis. We get neither money nor any hints from them.
