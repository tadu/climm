	* Makefile, src/Makefile: Fixes.
	* include/micq.h, include/color.h:

	  be used in i18n files.
	* src/util_ui.c: Implement the above in M_print ().

	  Tighten char * to const where appropriate.
	* lang/*.h: Remove.
	* lang/??.i18n: New localization files.
	* include/tabs.h, src/tabs.c, src/micq.c, src/file_util.c,
	  src/icq_response.c, src/mreadline.c, src/ui.c:
	  Implement tab list in a new extra module and use it.  Rename
	  get_tab() to R_process_input_tab(); avoid clobbering of input.
	* include/i18n.h, src/i18n.c, src/*.c:
	  Implement simple internationalization functions and use them.
	  Move some initialisation from micq.c and add Show_String_A()
	  to aid using the new functions.

2001-04-13 Rüdiger Kuhlmann <micq-list-CKH1bDCG6x4V@ruediger-kuhlmann.de>
	* include/micq.h, src/msg_queue.c, src/server.c, src/util.c:
	  ICQ# with 9 digits start showing up, so use 10 instead of 8 digits
	  for UIN/nick. Thus, rename Print_UIN_Name_8 to Print_UIN_Name_10.
	* src/file_util.c, src/util.c:
	  _Really_ use PROGDIR: if $HOME is unset on AmigaOS.
	* include/micq.h, src/file_util.c, src/micq.c:
	  New config option "LineBreakType" tied to int "line_break_type".
	* src/util_ui.c, src/icq_response.c, include/config.h:
	  Rewrote line break code from scratch. Doesn't use a buffer, but
	  printf %.*s stuff. Depending on line_break_type, can indent a text
	  embraced by ESC « ... ESC » by: start it on a new line, ignore it,
	  indent it to current column, or line break unless piece fits on
	  current line. Start using it for received msgs.
	* src/util.c: 
	  In MsgEllipsis, strips text after \r or \n (add a ¶ instead) and
	  print at most one line (assuming timestamp & UIN is printed
	  before).
	* include/ui.h, src/ui.c:
	  More time stamp first work.
	* src/file_util.c, src/micq.c, src/server.c, src/util_ui.c:
	  Minor cleanups.

2001-03-24 Rüdiger Kuhlmann <micq-list-CKH1bDCG6x4V@ruediger-kuhlmann.de>

	* include/config.h: Add #defines MSGSENTSTR, MSGACKSTR, MSGRECSTR
	  for the strings denoting a sent, acknowledged resp. received
	  message.
	* include/micq.h: New #defines SENTCOL and ACKCOL for the
	  respective colors.
	* src/icq_response.c, src/msq_queue, src/server.c, src/ui.c:
	  Modify to include timestamp at beginning of line.  Rewrite URL
	  message reception code not to use superfluous fixed-size buffers
	  anymore.
	* include/micq.h: Upped version to 0.4.6p2.

2001-03-24 Huub Reuver <theanaloguekid@tak.dhis.org>

	* src/file_util.c, src/micq.c, include/micq.h: Add config option
	  "Del_is_Del" tied to global BOOL del_is_bs, (default TRUE).
	* src/mreadline.c: Put backspace and delete processing into
	  seperate functions R_process_input_backspace() and
	  R_process_input_delete(); now ^h triggers backspace, ESC[3~
	  delete, and the delete character backspace or delete depending on
	  whether del_is_bs is set. Allow different arrow key codes
	  and stop beeping at end of line etc.
	* src/file_util.c, src/micq.c, include/micq.h: Add config option
	  "Last_UIN_Prompt" tied to global BOOL last_uin_prompt (default
	  FALSE).
	* include/ui.h, src/ui.c, src/util_ui.c: Change prompt to contain
	  last used UIN's name, if last_uin_prompt is set.

2001-03-23 Rüdiger Kuhlmann <micq-list-CKH1bDCG6x4V@ruediger-kuhlmann.de>
	* src/mselect.c: Zero fd set on failure of select() (e.g. caused
	  by interruption by SIGWINCH), which could freeze micq till a
	  server input.
	* src/util_ui.c: Use sigwinch handler in Get_Max_Screen_Width() to
	  update screen width if possible.
	* src/util_ui.c: Change color handling: Everything between
	  ESC and m ist either printed directly or ignored (if color is
	  off).
	* include/color.h: Add back BOLD #define.
	* include/micq.h, src/util.c, include/config.h: Add new functions
	  UIN2Name() and Print_UIN_Name_8() to better convert UIN to strings
	  resp. print them, and MsgEllipsis() to "shorten" messages to
	  MSGID_LENGTH characters, using ellipsis if necessary.
	* src/file_util.c, src/util.c: Prefer $HOME to PROGDIR: on AmigaOS.
	  Do not segfault if $HOME is unset.

 Moved initialization of table out front of 'if' block to prevent compiler
 warning. Improved error message, and now return without performing string
 conversion to prevent addressing memory out of range (table pointer would
 previously have remained uninitialized ( = bad)).
