Q: My friend uses Trillian, and...

A: Friends don't let friends use Trillian. Tell him to upgrad to Miranda or
   at least Trillian 0.75.

Q: My friend uses Trillian, and sometimes he can't send messages.

A: That's a well-known stupid bug on Trillian's side. It is unable to route
   a message through the server if for some reason it fails to send it
   directly. Unfortunately, mICQ used to hard-code that it isn't firewalled.
   This has been changed; if you're firewalled, and can't use SOCKS, you
   need to set the status field in your peer-to-peer connection. See
   micqrc.5 for details.

Q: When I send someone a message, it gives me some failed connections errors.

A: mICQ tries to send the messages directly if it can, so as soon as mICQ
   knows the target's IP address and port, the next message will cause it
   to try to open a connection to the target. It will try the external
   and the internal IP address, so you might get two error messages if it
   fails. It is harmless, because it will route the message through the
   server if it fails (we're not Trillain, are we?).

Q: When I start mICQ, I get lines like those:

07:33:10  Incoming v8 server packet: FLAP seq 000065e2 length 001a channel 2
 SNAC (15,1) [unknown] flags 0 ref eee0dc

A: The server for some reason gives an error when mICQ acknowledges the
   receipt of offline messages. This happens only for some servers you
   might be connected to. The message is harmless - you should just
   ignore it.
   If you wonder why mICQ still prints it then it's because it doesn't
   handle this packets yet and mICQ always prints unknown packets. This
   is so that I get feedback for new packets.
   If you get them every 30s, upgrade your mICQ.

Q: I have a bug in mICQ 0.4.2, ...

A: Go away. I'm not interested in bug reports for old versions, because
   they probably will already be fixed. Upgrade to the newest version,
   check the mailing list and this FAQ, and if the bug still persists,
   I'm more than willing to help you.

Q: When I try to login, I get an error 24.

A: Try again in 30min. AOL will block you with that error message if you
   login too often in too short a time.
