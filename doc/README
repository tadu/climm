This program and the author are in no way affiliated with Mirabilis.  
This program is designed as a text mode unix ICQ since the only ICQ client that
will run on a unix box is the java version which is slow and resource intensive.

Ok this is a work in progress but I figure this might help people
now that there's some semblence of an UI.

Micq is an ICQ client for text mode unix that is not in any way supported 
by Mirabilis.  This was done for two reasons :  I wanted to see if I could
and Mirabilis has been slow ( at best ) in releasing a unix port.

The code is designed to be portable and to day has been ported to most every 
flavor of Un*x, Amiga, OS/2, MiNT, Win32, Acron and probably others.  Let me 
know if you need any help porting it or if you would like your platform 
included in the default distribution.  

***********NOTE*************************
Solaris and SunOS require a switch to be set in the makefile.

Download

   ftp://micq.chatzone.org/pub/micq look for the newest directory.
   Files can be downloaded seperately or in a tgz archive.  It doesn't
   make sense to download both as they're the same thing.

Compiling

A linux i386 binary is included on the ftp site.  It should compile on any Unix 
no problem.  Amiga, OS/2, and Win32 might take some massaging. :)
Let me know how it handles.

To make micq type 'gmake' in the source directory.  If this doesn't work try
jusr 'make'  If it doesn't work email me at meadhros@yahoo.com

Usage

Ok to run it type micq
It will ask for your uin and password.  Two users are in the default contact 
list. The two users are two different uin's I use.  You can add more by editing
the ~/.micqrc file.
Ok if you successfully login then you can type 
msg uin/message
-or-
msg nickname/messgae
this will send message to the user uin.  
For multi-line messages leave the initial message blank.  This will put you in
multi-line mode ( msg> ) Now type the message and when you're done enter . on
a line by itself to end the message.  # on a line by itself cancels the message.
To exit just type quit or q and you will be logged off.
You can change your online status to NA or Away just like in the mirabilis 
client.  Type help to receive a list of modes you can change to. 
To view info about all the people in your contact list type w.  This 
gives not only people in your list's information but also your current status
mode.

Passwords

If you don't want your password stored on disk edit the ~/.micqrc file and 
remove the password line and you will be prompted to type it everytime Micq 
starts.

Putting a * in front of the uin of a member of your contact list will add
them to your visible list.
Putting a ~ in front of the uin of a member of your contact list will add
them to your invisible list.

Coding

Anyone who wants to add anything to this program or suggest features or
report bugs or bug fixes is welcome to do so.  I'll try to incorporate the 
stuff as soon as possible.  If you don't want to give ma anything just leech 
the code and do your own thing with it that's you choice.  I won't stop you 
unless you say that you made it or own it or anything stupid like that. Please
give me your improvments though so that development will go faster.

Micq is completely free but if you'd like to show your appreciation you could
send me a pizza.  I heard about this online and it sounded like a good idea. 
Contact me for more info.

If you ICQ say more than Hi! or else I might not respond I get hundreds of
people messaging me and can easily get overwhelmed.  I try to respond to all
email but no promises.
