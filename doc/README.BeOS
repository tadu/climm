climm is (c) Matt Smith, RÃ¼diger Kuhlmann, and released under version 2 of the GPL.

Note: This package requires libiconv. Get it from <URL:http://www.bebits.com/app/2971/>.

Note 2: This package requires a properly set locale. If you don't understand this, enter
"export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8" before you start climm, or edit your climmrc to contain
a line "encoding local UTF-8".

Note 3: I do develop climm, but I am not a BeOS developer. If you have BeOS-specific
questions, ask someone else. If you're a BeOS developer, you might want to help porting.

Note 4: There is a mailing list for climm, go to <URL:http://www.climm.org/> and subscribe.

Note 5: Don't ask me to make a version for SKELETONs. Access to this software is illegal
for me. If you do have access, then you're able to compile from source. Consider note 4.

Note 6: Don't ask me to make a GUI for this program, or whine that it's not a native BeOS
application. It is command-line only, and it comes from Linux. If you don't understand this,
come up with a commonly-used GUI toolkit that works under BeOS, AmigaOS, Linux, *BSD,
commercial Unices and Windows. Then make one yourself.

If you don't accept any of these notes, then please do not install this software.
