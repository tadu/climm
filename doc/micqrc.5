.SH NAME
.B ~/.micq/micqrc
\- The configuration file for micq
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes the configuration file for micq. It consists
of several sections that are started by
.IR [section] ,
where
.I section
is the name of the section. File or directory names given are taken relative
to the base directory, which is usually ~/.micq/.

.SH CONNECTIONS
A
.B Connection
section describes a connection within ICQ. Typically, there are two of them,
that are related to each other: a connection to the ICQ server, and a
connection to listen to peer to peer communication. You may also have a
remote control connection: that means a FIFO is opened, and lines read from
it are interpreted in the same way as input lines.
.TP
.BI type \ type\ [auto]
Set the connection type to
.IR type ,
which can be
.B server
for a connection to the ICQ server,
.B peer
for a connection listening to peer to peer communication, or
.B remote
for a remote control FIFO. If
.I auto
is given, create this connection on startup. You presumable want to do this,
unless you have several UINs, then set this on the connection corresponding
to this UIN you are using.
.TP
.BI version \ nr
Set the version of the protocol used for this connection to
.IR nr .
Please note that for a server connections, versions
.BR 5 ,
.B 7
and
.B 8
are supported, and for peer to peer connections
.BR 6 ,
.B 7
and
.BR 8 .
Remote control FIFOs don't have a version.
.TP
.BI server \ server
Set the server to connect to to
.IR server .
This defaults to
.IR login.icq.com .
Unused for peer to peer connections. For remote control fifos,
this is the path of the FIFO to be created.
.TP
.BI port \ port
Set the port to connect on the server to
.IR port ,
or the port to listen on for peer to peer connections to
.IR port .
.TP
.BI uin \ UIN
Set the UIN to log in with to
.IR UIN .
Unused for peer to peer connections and remote control FIFOs.
.TP
.BI password \ [password]
Set the password to log in with to
.IR password .
Unused for peer to peer connections. If omitted, ask for password on startup.
Note: BeOS users may not omit the password.
.TP
.BI status \ nr
Set the status to be on log in in to
.IR nr .
Status can be:
.RS
.TP
0
online
.TP
1
away
.TP
5
not available
.TP
17
occupied
.TP
19
do not disturb
.TP
32
free for chat
.TP
256
invisible
.RE

.RS
For peer to peer connections, this is used for the direct connection setting:
.TP
1
We're firewalled and can't receive any connection. Don't even try.
.TP
2
We're firewalled, but use SOCKS and can receive connections.
.TP
4
We're not firewalled at all. This is the default.
.RE
.RS
Remote control FIFOs do not use this setting.
.RE
.SH GENERAL
The
.B General
section includes the options for SOCKS 5, that may be eventually
moved to their own section, general options, and some strings to override.
.TP
.BI s5_use \ number
Set
.I number
to 0 to disable and 1 to enable.
.TP
.BI s5_host \ host
Connect to socks 5 proxy on host
.IR host .
.TP
.BI s5_port \ port
Connect to socks 5 proxy listening on port
.IR port .
.TP
.BI s5_auth \ number
Set
.I number
to 0 to omit authentication and 1 to do authentication.
.TP
.BI s5_name \ name
Identify as user
.I name
to socks 5 proxy.
.TP
.BI s5_pass \ password
Authenticate with password
.I password
to socks 5 proxy.
.PP
A few book-keeping options are usually placed at the beginning of
the micqrc file:
.TP
.BI encoding\ file\  encoding
Specify the encoding which is used for strings in this file as
.IR encoding .
mICQ will write this file in utf8 it utf8 is enabled, otherwise in the
current local encoding. If utf8 is disabled, mICQ will refuse to load the
file if the encoding given in this option does not agree with the current
local one.
.TP
.BI encoding\ local\  encoding
Specify the user's terminal's encoding as
.IR encoding .
This overrides the encoding derived from environment variables.
.TP
.BI encoding\ remote\  encoding
Set the encoding to use for meta data on the server,
including the password, to
.IR encoding .
This encoding is also used for communicating with other contacts
whose client doesn't understand utf8 messages unless a specific
encoding is set for this contact.
.TP
.BI format \ nr
Set the format this config file is to
.IR nr .
Currently, only format 1 is known and accepted.
.PP
Now the other options:
.TP
.BI verbose \ level
Set the verbosity level on startup to
.IR level .
.TP
.BI auto_away \ time
Set the time to set status to away after to
.I time
seconds. Set to
.I 0
to disable.
.TP
.BI Screen_width \ width
Set the default screen with to
.IR width .
If unset or
.IR 0 , \ 80
will be used. This is rarely needed as usually
the current screen width can be deduced on runtime.
.TP
.BI set \ delbs\ on|off
If set to
.BR on ,
let the delete character act as a backspace. When
.BR off ,
let it act as a delete character.
.TP
.BI set \ funny\ on|off
Disable or enable "funny" messages.
.TP
.BI set \ color\ on|off
Disable or enable the use of colors.
.TP
.BI set \ hermit\ on|off
If set to
.BR on ,
ignore all messages from everyone not on your contact list.
.TP
.BI set \ log\ on|off
Disable or enable logging.
.TP
.BI set \ logonoff\ on|off
When logging, disable or enable the logging of online/offline status changes.
.TP
.BI set \ auto\ on|off
Disable or enable automatic responses (reply messages).
.TP
.BI set \ uinprompt\ on|off
Disable or enable the use of the nick you last received a message from in the prompt.
.TP
.BI set \ autosave\ on|off
Disable or enable the automatic saving of the micqrc.
.TP
.BI set \ autofinger\ on|off
Disable or enable the automatic fingering of new UINs.
.TP
.BI set \ linebreak\ type
Configure the line break type for incoming messages to
.IR type ,
which can be
.B simple
to just wrap lines as usual,
.B break
to have a line break before each message,
.B indent
to have a line break and indent the message and
.B smart
to have a line break only if the message doesn't fit on the current line.
.TP
.BI set \ tabs\ simple|cycle|cycleall
Selects the style of tab cycling. Older versions of mICQ only knew
.BR simple ,
which would only work with the
.B msg
command and would complete the command and cycle through all contacts that
messages had been sent to or received from. Already typed text after the
nick name was lost.
.B cycle
however cycles through all online contacts on your contact list. It keeps all
other input text intact, however it also doesn't add the default
.B msg
command.
.B cycleall
is like
.BR cycle ,
it just cycles through all, and not only online, contacts.
.TP
.BI set \ silent\ type
Suppress some output, namely status changes for
.B on
and status changes, logins and logouts for
.BR complete .
.TP
.BI chat \ nr
Set the random chat group to
.IR nr .
Use
.B -1
to disable, and
.B 49
for mICQ (which is the default).
.PP

.TP
.BI color\ scheme \ nr
Select the color scheme number
.IR nr .
.TP
.BI color \ use\ color

If this command is omitted, the first active server connection is assumed.
.TP
.BI label \ <label>
