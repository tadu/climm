.SH COMMANDS CONCERNING MESSAGE SENDING
A
.I <contacts>
argument denotes a comma seperated list of contacts, that is, of UINs and
nick names. If it is the last argument, the contacts may also be seperated by spaces.
.TP
.BI msg \ <contacts>\ [message]
Send a message to all
.IR contacts .
Without
.I message
multi-line message mode is enabled.  To send the multi-line message, put
a period
.RB ( . )
on a line of its own.  To cancel the message, put a hash sign
.RB ( # )
on a line of its own.
.br
Outgoing and incoming messages are marked differently depending of the transport
used.
.B \(Fo\(Fo\(Fo
and
.B \(Fc\(Fc\(Fc
mark messages sent via a direct connection; if an outgoing message is not
acknowledged by the peer for some time, it is printed marked
.BR === .
.B \(Fo<<
and
.B >>\(Fc
mark icq8 (also called type-2) messages; if an outgoing message is not
acknowledged by the peer for some time, it is printed marked
.BR --= .
Lastly,
.B <<<
and
.B >>>
mark icq5 messages, which can be so called type-1, type-4 or offline
message. These kind of messages are not acknowledged.
.br
A message is first tried to be sent via a pre-existing direct connection; if
none is established, one is initiated in the background for further
messages. If no direct connection is open, or if the message is not
acknowledged after some time, the connection will be failed and the next
transport tried: sending as type-2 message. This step will be skipped if the
peer does not set the required capabilities to signal its ability to receive
them. If this is skipped, times out or returns an error, e.g. the peer has
gone offline in the time between, the message is sent as an ordinary type-4
message.
.br
If the peer signals its ability to accept them and support for them has not
been disabled at compile time, messages are sent UTF-8 encoded and
appropriately tagged. Otherwise, the message is sent encoded in the peer's
configured encoding, or, if unset, the default assumed remote encoding.
type-1, type-4 and offline messages can not be tagged with their encoding,
so successfull transmission of 8bit characters relies on correct
configuration.
