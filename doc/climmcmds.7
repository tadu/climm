.SH NAME
climm \- interactive commands
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes the commands that can be used within climm.  This
page holds the same information as the online help, but more precise and longer.
Notations: square brackets
.RB ( [] )
denote optional arguments, while angle brackets
.RB ( <> )
denote arguments (in opposite to keywords).
Specifically,
.I <uin>
denotes an arbitrary UIN,
while
.I <contacts>
denotes a comma separated list of contacts, that is, of UINs and
nick names. If it is the last argument, the contacts may also be separated by spaces.
.SH COMMANDS CONCERNING MESSAGE SENDING
.TP
.BI msg \ <contacts>\ [<message>]
Send a message to all
.IR contacts .
Without
.IR message ,
or with
.I message
ending in a backslash
.RB ( \(rs ),
multi\-line message mode is enabled.  To send the multi\-line message, put
a period
.RB ( . )
on a line of its own.  To cancel the message, put a hash sign
.RB ( # )
on a line of its own.
.br
Outgoing and incoming messages are marked differently depending of the transport
used.
.B \(Fo\(Fo\(Fo
and
.B \(Fc\(Fc\(Fc
mark messages sent via a direct connection.
.B \(Fo%\(Fo
and
.B \(Fc%\(Fc
mark messages sent via a direct connection that were encrypted (requires
GnuTLS or OpenSSL enabled at compile time).
.B \(Fo<<
and
.B >>\(Fc
mark icq8 (also called type\-2) messages.
Lastly,
.B <<<
and
.B >>>
mark icq5 messages, which can be so called type\-1, type\-4 or offline
message. These kind of messages are not acknowledged.
.br
A message is first tried to be sent via a pre\-existing direct connection; if
none is established, one is initiated in the background for further
messages. If no direct connection is open, or if the message is not
acknowledged after some time, the connection will be failed and the next
transport tried: sending as type\-2 message. This step will be skipped if the
peer does not set the required capabilities to signal its ability to receive
them. If this is skipped, times out or returns an error, e.g. the peer has
gone offline in the time between, the message is sent as an ordinary type\-4
message.
.br
If the peer signals its ability to accept them,
messages are sent UTF\-8 encoded and
appropriately tagged. Otherwise, the message is sent encoded in the peer\'s
configured encoding, or, if unset, the default assumed remote encoding.
type\-1, type\-4 and offline messages can not be tagged with their encoding,
so successful transmission of non\-USASCII\-characters relies on correct
configuration and heuristics.
.TP
.BI a \ [<message>]
Send a message to the last person you sent a message to.
Auto-expanding alias for
.BR msg\ %a .
.TP
.BI r \ [<message>]
Reply to last message received.
Auto-expanding alias for
.BR msg\ %r .
.TP
.BI url \ <contacts>\ <url>\ <message>
Send a
.I message
regarding an
.I url
to all
.IR contacts .
.TP
.BI sms \ [<nick>]\ [<cell>]\ <message>
Send an SMS message
.I message
to cell phone number
.IR cell ,
which looks like +<country code><number>,
or to the cell phone number of
.IR nick ,
which will be set to
.IR cell
if unset. You may not specify
.IR cell
if
.IR nick
already has a cell phone number given. Invalid cell phone numbers
will be removed from the
.IR nick \'s
meta data.
.TP
.BI chat \ <contacts>\ [<message>]
Sends a message
.I message
to contacts
.I contacts
just as the
.B msg
command. After the message is sent (or cancelled), multi-line mode
is entered and messages sent until an empty message is cancelled.
Cancelling a non-empty message will only cancel the message itself,
and more messages in multi-line mode can be sent.
.TP
.BI getauto \ [auto|away|na|dnd|occ|ffc]\ [<contacts>]
Requests auto message from
.IR contacts
for given status, where
.B away
is for away,

for not available,
.B dnd
for do not disturb,
.B occ
for occupied and

or nothing is given, the auto message for the contacts
is fetched for their respective status. Contacts not in any of those

Set option
.I option
for contact
.IR contact ,
contact group
.IR contact\ group ,
for the current connection or globally to the value
.IR value ,
or display the current value, or display all options and their settings.
.br
When resolving options for contacts, the option for the contact itself will be used,
if set; otherwise, if the contact belongs to a group, the option for that group, if set;
otherwise, if the contact belongs to a server connection (i.e. is not yet removed),
the option for the server connection; otherwise the global option, if set. Otherwise,
0 for integer options, FALSE for boolean options, the color string for "no color"
unless this color string is requested, or the empty string for string options.

When resolving options for contact groups, the same is done except for the
first step; options for connections are taken from the connection, then
globally; and global options, of course, only globally.

to output verbatim.
