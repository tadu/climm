Read README for information on getting starte with Micq this is mostly for
power users who insist on tinkering with things. :)

Customizable commands have been implemented via the rc file, the keywords are:

message_cmd
add_cmd
info_cmd
quit_cmd
reply_cmd
again_cmd
list_cmd
away_cmd
na_cmd
dnd_cmd
online_cmd
occ_cmd
ffc_cmd
inv_cmd
status_cmd
auth_cmd
auto_cmd
change_cmd
search_cmd
url_cmd
update_cmd

to set the message command (normally msg) to say /msg add the following line 
to .micqrc

message_cmd /msg

Be sure to have an carriage return at the end of the statement.
Also be sure to have only one space seperating the command and the keyword 
( message_cmd, etc. ) or else the space will be come part of the command.
Commands can't contain spaces so this would be bad.
